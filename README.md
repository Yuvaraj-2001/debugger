<h2> The debugger generator </h2>
<p>Most of us thought that if we have a tool to write debbugger to every function, but don't worry i have covered for you</p>

<h4> Rules </h2>
<ul>
  <li>The code should be already been pretty print</li>
  <li>The code should be pasted in left side of text area</li>
  <li>The code will be generated in right text box</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h4>
  Uses </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>First you can copy the result code and paste</li>
    <li>debbugger will be generated next line after the function line</li>
    <li>Remember this debugger will work in funtion level, and only on javascript file and <b>noot ts</b></li>
